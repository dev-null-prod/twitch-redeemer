Javascript Twitch Channel Points Auto-Redeemer

Redeems a Twitch Channel Points reward (currently manually specified in the function getSelectItemButton in content.js)

A bit buggy but functional, if you turn it off and on again it'll read the current reward cooldown and set it as its own wait time.
